	<p><b>How to play</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the available tools to try to match the image on the right. Note that if the canvas is not full-size,
			you should be comparing only with the top-left portion that matches, not attempting to draw the entire image
			re-scaled.</li>
		<li>Checks are sent with each percentage point of similarity, which can be seen at the bottom right along with
			the maximum score in logic.</li>
		<li>The <b>Archipelago Text Client</b> is accessible under the <b>Extras</b> menu.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Additional features</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use <b>File->Open Goal Image</b> or <b>Ctrl+O</b> to use a custom image. The image will be stretched to fill
			the canvas and if transparency is present, will overlay the default image.</li>
		<li>Use <b>Extras->Similarity Mode</b> or <b>Ctrl+Shift+M</b> to visualize the similarity between your image
			and the target. White is perfect similarity, black is no similarity.</li>
		<li>Use <b>Extras->Difference Mode</b> or <b>Ctrl+M</b> to visualize the differences between your image and the
			target. If a given color is not gray, you should aim to shift the hue toward the shown color. If the given
			color is especially light or dark, you should lighten or darken to match. A perfectly similar color will
			appear the same neutral gray as the area around the canvases.</li>
		<li>The <b>Pick Color</b> tool, once unlocked, can be used on the target image as well as on the main canvas.
		</li>
